# Semantic Web Project

The goal is to build a knowledge graph to explore regularities, patterns, and trends in UFO sightings.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Any dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

You can install Jupyter Notebook and other dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter notebook
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Notebooks Overview

1) Preprocessing.ipynb: Used for managing and visualizing the ontology.
2) SPQRQL.ipynb: Contains SPARQL queries for interacting with the knowledge graph.

### Running the Notebooks

1) Navigate to the root directory of the project where the notebooks are located.
2) Start the Jupyter Notebook server:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3) Your default web browser should open automatically with a list of files in the project directory. If it doesn't, copy and paste the URL from the terminal into your browser.
4) Click on the notebook you wish to run (Preprocessing.ipynb then SPQRQL.ipynb).

5) Run the cells in the notebook by selecting each and pressing Shift + Enter, or by using the "Run" button in the toolbar.

### Interacting with the Notebooks

1) Preprocessing.ipynb: Contains code for cleaning our data
2) SPQRQL.ipynb: Contains some of the queries which can be run against our knowledge graph
